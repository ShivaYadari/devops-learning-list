# devops-learning-list

#### Why devops-learning-list? 
 - Number of open-ended interview questions that tell you more about the person's capabilities than a straight answer would. 
 - My own wiki to document and tackle day to day problems in DevOps. 
 - Quick reference to get started (without overwhelming in official documentation)
 
**Note:** This is an ongoing effort and totally based on my personal experiences, feel free to submit a PR to contribute to this list.
